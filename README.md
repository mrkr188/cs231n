#  CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
My solutions for [cs231n](http://cs231n.github.io) standford course assignments. 
  
The assignments include implementations of Machine Learning algorithms like Knn, Softmax Classification, Multiclass SVM, Fully Connected Neural Networks, Concolutional Neural Networks to image classification. The main tackaway from these assignments learning to write efficient vectorized implementaions of Machine Learning algorithms using Python, Numpy.
